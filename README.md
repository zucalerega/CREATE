# CREATE
This code is for connecting an infrared input to the rotation of a servo motor. 
To run the code, upload it onto your Ardunio IDE and download the required packages
that are imported in the script. Then upload it to your Arduino, power it, and the servo
should rotate 10 degrees on every remote input.
